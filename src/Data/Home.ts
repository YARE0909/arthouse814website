      "I get Sohana over the weekends to spend time with Alok, who is the art teacher. My daughter is a special child and my intent is to use art as a way to build her cognitive skills. Alok is an effective teacher who is patient, applies techniques to help her, is very patient with her and works with her at her pace. Iâ€™m certain that over a period of time, with Alok's expertise, Sohana will be able to use Art as a way of expressing herself. I am lucky that I found such an empathetic teacher who is devoted to all his students and works to make them successful and that includes, my Sohana too.",
